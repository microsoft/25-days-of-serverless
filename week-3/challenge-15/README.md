# Challenge 15: Cognitive Services with Computer Vision

![Mrs. Claus](https://res.cloudinary.com/jen-looper/image/upload/v1575488631/images/challenge-15_ohenlt.jpg)

Here in Munich, Germany, Felix is excited to go to a traditional _Weihnachtsmarkt_, a holiday market! He keeps texting photos to his friend Anna about all the fun things he's doing: drinking hot mulled _Glühwein_, going ice skating, shopping for presents.
But Anna can't find her glasses, and can't clearly see what's in the pictures!

For today's challenge, Anna needs a service that, given an image, describe the image and gives some keywords about what it contains.
