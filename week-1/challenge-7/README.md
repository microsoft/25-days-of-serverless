December 7 marks the first day of the official Christmas season in Guatemala. Everybody is scrambling to get ready for the big _la quema del diablo_ (burning of the devil) tonight — at 6pm sharp, everyone will start a bonfire to burn rubbish and items they don't need to cleanse their homes of evil.

Here in Guatemala City, our friend Miguel is concerned about the environmental impact! The past few years, people have been burning a lot of rubber and plastic that makes the air dirty. Some places are switching to burning paper piñatas of the devil, but Miguel still wants to let people metaphorically cleanse their houses of specific items they don't want.

Let's help Miguel by building a web API that lets his neighbors search for images of things they want to get rid of. Build an application (e.g. a cloud function with a single endpoint) that takes text as an input and returns an image found on unsplash or another image platform.

## Resources/Tools Used 🚀
Here are the tools listed that we used for an example solution.

-   **[Azure Functions with Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-java-maven/?WT.mc_id=25daysofserverless-github-sakriema)**
-   **[Java JSON parser org.json](https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.json%22%20AND%20a%3A%22json%22)**
-   **[UNSPLASH Picture API](https://unsplash.com/)**

## Tips 🔥

Make sure to keep your keys private. Profit e.g. from environment variables to do so;

```bash
> export UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="your_access_key"
> export UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
```
