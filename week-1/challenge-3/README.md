## Secret Santa's Furry Friends

'Tis the season for gift giving! Here at Microsoft HQ in Redmond, we're excited for¬†our annual Secret Santa gift swap! Each¬†employee who chooses to participate is assigned another coworker to give a gift to. Rather than put a price limit on gifts, though, Satya has decided that this year everyone is just going to send their favorite cute animal picture. To make sure people can't easily figure out who their Secret Santa is, he wants to make sure that all of the photos are stored in the same format (`png`) and are made available from a single database.

For this challenge, create a web service that gets called everytime a commit or push is made to a Github repository. If the commit has a file ending with `.png`, your service should take the URL to the image from Github and store it in whatever database you like.
