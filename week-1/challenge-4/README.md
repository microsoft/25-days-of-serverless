# Challenge 4: API Endpoint

![Ezra and his dinner dilemma](https://res.cloudinary.com/jen-looper/image/upload/v1575132446/images/challenge-4_shxtjs.jpg)

Here in Brooklyn, NY, Ezra wants to have a big holiday potluck before everyone travels home for the holidays! His tiny apartment can barely fit everyone in, but it's a cozy way to celebrate with friends. He usually uses an online spreadsheet to coordinate who's bringing what, to make sure there's varieties of food to meet all dietary needs.

But the grinch stole all the servers! So Ezra can't do that this year.

Build an HTTP API that lets Ezra's friends add food dishes they want to bring to the potluck, change or remove them if they need to (plans change!), and see a list of what everybody's committed to bring.
